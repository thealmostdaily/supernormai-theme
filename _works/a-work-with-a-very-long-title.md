It’s about the work, not the money.

There are no shortcuts worth taking in painting – you have to get in the studio and put in the hours.

Travel every couple of years (ideally overseas) is good for me. A change of scene opens the mind as well as the eyes.

Go and see the best art you can, as often as possible.

Never paint drunk.
