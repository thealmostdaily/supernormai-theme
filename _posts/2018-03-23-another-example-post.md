At the Serpentine looking at the paintings of Rose Wylie. Noticing in particular the way the works are constructed. Separate pieces of canvas stuck on and over existing painting. A way of keeping the surface and brushwork fresh, of covering mistakes and areas that just aren’t working.

Cup rings, smudges and dirty marks – some of these pieces of canvas look like they’ve been lying around the studio for years. On the paintings you can see pencil marks, workings out clearly legible.

The newer the work the thicker the paint. A painting of a top down view of a football stadium is reminiscent of a child’s birthday cake, thick with icing.

*Elephant* is a cadmium red splurge. Oil sticks too I imagine. And there are those cut up pieces of canvas again, somehow stuck to the surface. The colour reminds me of a tin of Spectrum oil paint I used to own back when you could still get flake white (lead white) in tubes. The painting sitting in the tin, a small pool of oil sitting in an impression. Such a strong colour.
